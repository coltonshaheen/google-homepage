# google-homepage

Non-functioning reconstruction of Google homepage for The Odin Project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).

Improved some of my CSS and HTML skills. This was helpful in bringing me back up to speed on basic web design. I thought this would be a lot easier, but I think I did well in the end. Still can't fix the "Sign in" button though...
